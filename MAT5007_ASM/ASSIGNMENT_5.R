# EXPERIMENT 1
# Experience has shown that 20% of a manufactured product is of top quality.

# down the R programming code to test whether the production of the day chosen 
# is a representative sample at 95% confidence level.

# EXPERIMENT 2
# A sample of 900 items is found to have a mean of 3.47 cm. Write down the R
