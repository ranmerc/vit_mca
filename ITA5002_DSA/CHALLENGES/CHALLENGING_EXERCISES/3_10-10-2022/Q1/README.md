# Question

In a theme park, the Roller-Coaster ride is started only
when a good number of riders line up in the counter
(say 20 members). When the ride proceeds with these 20
members, a new set of riders will line up in the counter.
This keeps continuing. Implement the above scenario of
lining up and processing using arrays with Queue ADT.
