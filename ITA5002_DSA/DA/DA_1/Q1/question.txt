Develop a program to find the parity is EVEN PARITY or ODD
PARITY of the given ERROR DETECTION CODE given as the input
string. The given input string contains only the binary digits (bits) either
0 or 1. Assume the input string is of the half word length i.e. 16 bits and
the last bit is allocated to assign the parity. The parity bit ZERO i.e 0
represents EVEN PARITY and the parity bit ONE i.e 1 represents ODD
PARITY.
